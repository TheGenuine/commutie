# commutie
Android App to display a notification for the next Irish rail train at the times when you commute.

I created this App as part of the **Science Hack Day Dublin** to solve a problem of mine.
I have to take the DART to get to work and now and then (or more often) the train is delayed.
I would like to know of that at the times when I am usually commuting. Since Irish Rail provides an
open API I build this app.


**That is all I put together in like 36 hours of hacking, the app is far from finished and when I
find time I will wrap it up and maybe even upload to the Play store**
